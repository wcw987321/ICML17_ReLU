# This script starts the database server and runs a series of operation against server implementation.
# If the server is implemented correctly, the output (both return values and JSON block) will match the expected outcome.
# Note that this script does not compare the output value, nor does it compare the JSON file with the example JSON.

# Please start this script in a clean environment; i.e. the server is not running, and the data dir is empty.
